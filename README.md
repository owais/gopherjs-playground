# gopherjs-playground


Nothing seriour here. The code is riddled with bugs like race conditions, zero error handling etc. I just use it to experiment with GopherJS.


###  Running

```
* go get
* gopherjs serve
* cd server
* go run main.go
```
Open http://localhost:9100 and use arrow keys. The open the same page in another browser.
